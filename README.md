 This was a submission for project 3 of Udacity's Fullstack nanodegree. The main focus for this project was building the Flask backend so please excuse the rushed design.

The project allows a user to login via a Google account using Oauth2 and create profiles containing a picture, contact info and any projects they would like to show. Each project take a name, picture, description, github URL, and a live demo URL.

##Requirements:
The project was tested and developed with:

* flask 0.10.1 and flask version dependencies (Jinja, etc)
* python 2.7.10
* SQL Alchemy 1.0
* oauth2client
* SQLite3

## Notes for grading:
Requirements should be met within the default udacity vagrant setup.

Category = profile

Project = catalog item

Main.py should comply with PEP8 standards except camelCase function and variable names due to the style of code in teaching.

##Running the project
